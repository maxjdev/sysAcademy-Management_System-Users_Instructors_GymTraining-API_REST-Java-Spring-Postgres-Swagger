## Description

sysAcademy is an academy management solution developed using Java and Spring Framework technologies. Using Spring Boot, Spring Web and Spring Data JPA, the project offers a RESTful API to facilitate the management of users, instructors and bodybuilding training.

The sysAcademy architecture follows good development practices, with well-structured controllers, services, repositories, entities and DTOs for CRUD operations. Furthermore, the project makes use of modern technologies such as Spring DevTools to facilitate development and increase the team's productivity.

Integration with a PostgreSQL database in a Docker container provides an efficient and scalable persistence layer, ensuring secure and reliable storage of the academy's data.

API documentation is provided interactively by Swagger, allowing a clear and detailed view of available endpoints, which facilitates the development, testing and integration of new features.

Additionally, the project makes use of Lombok to reduce code verbosity, simplifying class writing and making code cleaner and more readable. Data validations are guaranteed by integration with the Spring validation library, ensuring the consistency and integrity of the data manipulated by the application.

Finally, tools such as Postman are used to test and validate the API, ensuring its quality and reliability in different usage scenarios.
